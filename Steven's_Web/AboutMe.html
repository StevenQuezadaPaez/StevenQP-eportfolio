    <p>Hi my name is Steven Quezada Paez and I am 19 years old. I am Dominican but born and raised in New York. Throughout my life art has played a major role. It allowed me to express myself without speaking instead it let my creativity speak for me. I think the reason I love art is because when I was little I was always closed off from the outside world due to my parents always caring about my safety. Since I didn't have enough experience socializing with other people I used art as a way to help me. I enjoy spending most of my time drawing, playing games with friends and listening to music. Playing sports wasn't really my thing but I like playing baseball and football and occasionally soccer.   </p></body>
